Having dealt with hard times during the past year, I'm writing about things that worked for me. By worked for me i mean that systematically give results in minutes.

1. Jerking off
I have used this in my online quizzes. When overwhelmed, jerking off gives me a 30mn to 3 hours focus headspace and kills my overwhelm. It got me decent scores on quizzes i didn't prepare for that much.
2. Redbull
It has an effet if you haven't drank it in the last couple of day or if you of drink more than usual.

What works in the long run:
3. Pizza
It gives me a boost in energy not in minutes but in the hours (12h+) that come after eating.
